A Repo to store all f**ing non-sense tasks from one of our lecturer that doesn't even introduce us a basic understanding to make a web program with PHP and CRUD model **AT ALL**.

This repo is basically a fork from [**this original repo**](https://github.com/efimeida/database_oracle_outfitstore) by **@efimeida**.

A goal for this fork is to port all Oracle SQL queries to MySQL so it's more easier to understand by most of my friends.
